# GeneticAlgorithmBinary
My implementation of the Genetic Algorithm using binary.

I wanted to learn the genetic algorithm and practice with it programatically. I implemented it using binary to start off
simple, it learns from a random population and makes individuals pair and produce an offspring that mixes of the two parents
in order to get the desired target individual entered by the user.
